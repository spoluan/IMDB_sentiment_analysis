**Project Descriptions**

In this project, I utilize the large movie review dataset, which offers a more extensive collection of data for binary sentiment classification. The dataset includes a total of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. Additionally, there is supplementary unlabeled data that can be utilized as well. The dataset is available in both raw text and pre-processed bag of words formats. For further information about this dataset, please refer to [this paper.](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf)
